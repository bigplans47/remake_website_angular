A Project to make a Doctor Info API

Remake the Trip Advisor website using the Javascript Angular 5 framework. This site is meant to focus on showing the user local destinations in Budapest and can collect additional places in Budapest to add to its database of places to see.

To Test Locally

git clone to your desktop, in terminal go to the root directory $ npm install -y to install all required packages. To see the site $ng serve and in your browser go to url http://localhost:4200/

Specifications:
More directives (practice with ngIf, ngFor, and more).
Full CRUD functionality that changes your models.
Firebase (a noSQL database) instead of a hard-coded dataset.
Seed data for your database.
Pipes for filtering data.
A router for adding additional pages.
Authentication and route guards.
Deployment (as a dry run for next week).
API calls.
CSS styling.
Tests using Jasmine and Protractor.
